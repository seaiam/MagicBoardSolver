- Ask user what size d he wants the board to be from 5 to 20
- Create a Board object with dimensions dxd. 
    the values of each square can be from 0 to d-1
    Assign only ONE value of 0
    The board is made of BoardBox objects , which have a certain value from 0 to d-1 and an indicator of which adjacent boxes
    were already explored.
- Ask the user from which corner he wants to start the game



ITERATIVE SOLUTION
Using Stack
Create a Stack of BoardBox objects
Push the current cell into the Stack

while the stack is not empty
    pop the current cell
    if current cell == goal cell , return true
    
    -If we can go south
        set south visited
        push current cell, push south cell
    -If we can go East
        set east visited
        push current cell, push east cell
    -If we can go west
        set west visited
        push current cell, push west cell
    -If we can go north
        set north visited
        push current cell, push north cell

return false 

RECURSIVE SOLUTION
-If 0 is found, return true
-If we can go south
    set south visited
    if findZeroSouth() , return true;
-If we can go East
    set east visited
    if findZeroEast(), return true
-If we can go west
    set west visited
    if findZeroWest(), return true
-If we can go north
    set north visited
    if findZeroNorth(), return true

return false
